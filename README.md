Instructions
Trying to watch a movie can sometimes be confusing in theaters. Let's create a program that simulates the ticket buying process. Theaters have a number of available movies during operating hours. Movies can have different showings on different screens at the same time.

Problems
Create a Customer class. Each customer has an ID and an age.
When I show up to the theater, I want to see all the movies available neatly on a monitor. I want to know which available movies I can see based on my age.
I want to watch a movie, but I only have 90 minutes. Which movie(s) can I watch?
A group of people want to watch an action movie, but don't want to wait for more than X hours. Which movie(s) can they watch?
I plan to get to the movie theater at X time. I need to leave by Y time. What are my choices?
A number of people are waiting in line for a particular title. Determine whether there are enough seats available so all of the eligible people can watch the title without having to wait more than X amount of time.
I want go on a movie marathon. Can the theater recommend me a schedule so that I can see a suspense, a comedy, and an action movie before the theater closes?
Bonus: I have a child under 13 years old that wants to watch a movie. There are two movie theaters in my area. What different movie titles can I ask my child that they want to watch? (You must use a Set)
